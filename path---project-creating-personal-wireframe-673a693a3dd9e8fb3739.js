At this point in the course you&#8217;ll be treating yourself as the client. Even though you won&#8217;t be conducting any sort of interview with yourself, it&#8217;s still important to build the foundation of making <strong>content driven decisions</strong> in the layout and structure of your page.</p>\n<h2 class="learn-activity">Activity: Creating Your Site Wireframe</h2>\n<p>The wireframe that you create in this activity will be used to inform the personal webpage that you build over the next few activities. The first build you&#8217;re going to do is to create a static (unchanging) site using HTML and CSS only. This static site will have 3 pages. For this activity, you&#8217;ll be creating the wireframes for each page.</p>\n<h3>Steps:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sketch the layout for the home page of your site</li>\n<li>Keep it basic! Draw boxes for images and basic lines for content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, the wireframe should be a crude sketch that conveys information about layout, structure, and content. Don&#8217;t worry about including decorations such as color. If you want to jot down some ideas about images and colors, you should do so as notes.</p>\n<p>The more that you annotate and markup the page, the more informed you&#8217;ll be about what you want. However, the goal of the wireframe is to be a clear and coherent blueprint that you can follow once you begin designing. As far as a must-do for this activity, you should only move forward once you have a clear blueprint that will help you make informed decisions about the content and layout of the site.</p>\n'}},pathContext:{}}}});
