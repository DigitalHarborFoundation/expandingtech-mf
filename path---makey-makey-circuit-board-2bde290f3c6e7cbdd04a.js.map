Play-Doh is a great tool for interactive projects because you can create anything you can imagine. However, please make sure to put any unused Play-Doh back in the containers and close the lid to preserve the conductivity! When you&#8217;re done, think back to the conductivity lesson and try to brainstorm some other objects that could be used for this project.</p>\\n<h4>Steps:</h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Get a Makey Makey kit from one of the program staff.</li>\\n<li>Plan out the design for your drums.

Think about what you learned in the last lesson and see if you can figure this out. Feel free to use Google or draw on your own knowledge about conductivity and Play-Doh! Once you have an answer tell one of the program staff!</p>\\n<h2><span style=\\\"color: #0091c9;\\\">Activity: Material Buffet</span></h2>\\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve made your Play-Doh Drum Machine it&#8217;s time to expand into other materials!
