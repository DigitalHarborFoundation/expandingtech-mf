You can switch tabs by clicking on them, or using keyboard shortcuts.</li>\n<li><em>Bookmarks Bar</em>: If you enable this, you can store bookmarks for quick access on this bar.</li>\n<li><em>User Login</em>: This is located in the upper right corner. This shows which user is currently browsing Chrome.</li>\n<li><em>Google Tool Bar</em>: If you&#8217;re logged in, this is quick access for Google Tools such as Mail, Drive, and other apps.</li>\n<li><em>Google Search Bar</em>: This is where you can type your search terms. This is different from the URL bar, where you enter webpage addresses.</li>\n<li><em>Common Sites</em>: These are your commonly visited sites. These can be deleted at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Here is a screenshot of the google.com homepage:<br />\n<img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MF_-_Digital_Communication_-_Getting_to_Know_Your_Browser_-_Chrome_2-600px2.jpg" alt="Google Search Homepage" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>The Address Bar and Sign-in buttons are highlighted. The main part of this screen is the search bar, where you type your search query.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Here&#8217;s a closer look at the Address Bar:<br />\n<img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MF_-_Digital_Communication_-_Getting_to_Know_Your_Browser_-_Chrome_3-600px3.jpg" alt="Chrome Address Bar Zoom" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>To the left of the Address Bar are the arrows for Back and Forward, as well as the X which stops a page from loading, and the Home, which returns to your set homepage.</li>\n<li>Next to any open tabs there is a little box. Clicking this will add a new tab to the Tab Bar.</li>\n<li>On the far right of the Address Bar there is a little star. This is to quickly Bookmark a page.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Resources:</h2>\n<p><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts:</a> Here is a collection of useful keyboard shortcuts that will save you lots of time when using Chrome.
