Remember, while Scratch is a great way to create games in itself, one of the purposes of Scratch is to become familiar with programming concepts that will transfer over to other game engines such as Unity. The <strong>Game Development Mini Project</strong> will require you to include each of these skills in addition to the ones covered in the <strong>Scratch Intermediate Skills</strong> lesson. Make sure to become familiar with each of these areas and the associated code blocks!</p>\n<h3>Goals:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Become familiar with coding the basic game mechanics that are presented in this section</li>\n<li>Understand how conditional statements and loops work</li>\n<li>Practice these skills by creating your own examples</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Skill Areas</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>KeyPress</strong> &#8211; Create a script that causes something to happen when a key is pressed.\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>Key press scripts are versatile and have a variety of applications. Some common uses include <em>motion</em>, <em>interaction</em>, and <em>controls</em> such as shooting a laser or jumping.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Key_Press_1-600px3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Key_Press_1-600px3.jpg" alt="Scratch Key Press" /></a></li>\n<li><strong>Sound effect</strong> &#8211; Include an event that triggers a sound.\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>Sounds can be playing as a loop in a <strong>backdrop</strong> or as <strong>sound effects</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Sound_1-600px1.jpg target = "><img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Sound_1-600px1.jpg" alt="Scratch Sound Effect" /></a></li>\n<li><strong>Motion</strong> &#8211; Create a script that causes motion. This can be for a sprite, an item, or something else entirely!\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>There are many methods for handling <em>motion</em>. You&#8217;ll find that you may prefer one way over another- just make sure to practice moving. This can be for a character, an item, a laser, or something completely different.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Motion_1-600px2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Motion_1-600px2.jpg" alt="Scratch Motion" /></a></li>\n<li><strong>If statement</strong> &#8211; Create a script using the <em>If () then</em> block. If statements are examples of <em>conditional statements &#8211;</em> an important aspect of programming.\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>An important use of these statements is to <em>check conditions</em>. This block allows for a quick check to see if something is true or not and then perform an action based on the result.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_If_and_Forever-600px7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_If_and_Forever-600px7.jpg" alt="Scratch If Forever" /></a></li>\n<li><strong>Loop</strong> &#8211; Create a script with a simple loop. This can be either a <em>F</em><em>orever</em> loop or a <em>R</em><em>epeat</em> block.\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>Loops are another important aspect of programming. Proper understanding and use will save you from having to enter the same code multiple times.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[box type=&#8221;info]If you need more detailed help with each of these sections make sure to check out the <em><a href="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/files/ScratchToolsandTricksPDF.pdf">Scratch Tools and Tricks PDF</a></em>.[/box]</p>\n<p>Check out the Wikipedia entry on <em>Game Mechanics</em> if you&#8217;re curious about certain terms and elements in Scratch.<br />\nHere&#8217;s the link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics alt=">Game Mechanics on Wiki</a>.</p>\n<p>If you need inspiration or a starting point for your project make sure to check out the <b>Staff Studio</b>. Nearly all of the projects contain examples of these elements.
