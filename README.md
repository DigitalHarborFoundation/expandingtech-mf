# Expanding Tech: Maker Foundations

This is a **working prototype** for the offsite Maker Foundations that'll be used by the _Expanding Tech_ sites.

## What Currently Works:

* All lessons linked in the sidebar navigation
* Course navigation between lessons (previous lesson/home/next lesson)
* All content pulls directly from the Maker Foundations course on Learn

## Please Test/Leave Feedback On:

* The UI/UX of the course:
  * Is it clear enough?
  * Is it distraction free?
  * Is the content front and center?
* Course content:
  * What wording should we change so that the content is universal?
  * General Maker Foundations content updates

## Next Steps:

Please use this repo to check out the above areas. I'm going to refactor the code before we launch to clean it up.

This was a working prototype and there are some areas I need to fix.

The site is currently deployed on GitHub Pages because I had some issues with Netlify. I'm not sure what's going on with it, but I figured GH Pages works great for now.

I'm going to keep working here as I update content. Moving from this to the final, refactored version won't take long. It's mainly a matter of making things cleaner.

Thanks!
