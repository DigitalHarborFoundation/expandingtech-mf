Make sure that you have a solid understanding of the skills introduced in the <strong>Scratch</strong><strong> Basic Skills</strong> section. These skills are more complicated and build upon some of the previous skills. Remember, the purpose of Scratch is to become familiar with programming concepts. It&#8217;s highly recommended to make sure you understand the contents of these lessons.</p>\n<h3>Lesson Objectives:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn about intermediate programming concepts and how to create them in Scratch</li>\n<li>Practice using intermediate skills in Scratch: variables, broadcasts/listeners, and collisions</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Learning Intermediate Skills</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Game Development Mini Project</strong> will require you to include each of these skills in addition to the ones covered in the <strong>Scratch Basic Skills</strong> lesson. This section introduces aspects that are very important to coding and development. Make sure to become familiar with each of these areas and the associated code blocks!</p>\n<p>[box type=&#8221;info]All of the following examples are available in the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/953410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maker Foundations Staff: Spring 2015</a> studio. [/box]</p>\n<ol>\n<li> <strong>Variables </strong>&#8211;<em>Variables</em> are contained in the <em>Data </em>category and can be used to track and trigger events.\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding variables is a crucial component of coding and becoming familiar with how to use and manipulate them will provide a solid foundation for any future programming.</li>\n<li>For a more detailed look at variables, check out the <em>Scratch Tools and Tricks</em><strong> </strong>pdf.

Broadcasting is combined with a <em>Listener </em>that is used to detect when the message is sent.\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>The sprite sending the message can be completely independent from the sprite receiving the message.</li>\n<li>Broadcasting is useful if a script needs to be activated <i>after the start of the program</i> <i>without a user prompt</i> such as a keypress or mouse click.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Broadcast-600px2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Broadcast-600px2.jpg" alt="Scratch Broadcast" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Listener_1-600px11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Listener_1-600px11.jpg" alt="Scratch Listener" /></a></li>\n<li><strong>Collision Detection</strong> &#8211; <i>Collision detection</i> is the term used to determine if two (or more) objects are touching.\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>This is a set of blocks used to detect if two objects are touching each other. This must be combined with a <i>forever loop</i> that will run and continuously ask itself ‘Is this sprite touching ___?’</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Collision_Detection-600px3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Scratch_Collision_Detection-600px3.jpg" alt="Scratch Collision Detection" /> </a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are several sensor options for Collision Detection.
