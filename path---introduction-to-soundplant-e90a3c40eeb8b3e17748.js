The interface is user-friendly and supports drag-and-dropping onto the keyboard map. Like the Makey Makey, Soundplant is an excellent tool for exploring interactivity in your projects. In fact, Soundplant combines so well with the Makey Makey that you would think that they were built for each other!</p>\n<h3>Lesson Objectives:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch Soundplant and explore the interface</li>\n<li>Practice finding and loading new sounds into Soundplant</li>\n<li>Experiment with the example drum sounds and add new sounds</li>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find and load new sounds into Soundplant</span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Using Soundplant</h2>\n<p>Soundplant is user-friendly and a tool that can be understood through exploration! Here are some quick steps and resources to help you get started:</p>\n<h4>Launching Soundplant</h4>\n<p>Click on the magnifying glass at the top right of your desktop and search for &#8220;Soundplant.&#8221; This will locate the file. Go ahead and click on it to launch Soundplant! Alternatively, you can use the Launchpad to start the software. Launchpad is the rocket ship icon on the Dock that you used to launch Inkscape.</p>\n<p>You should have Soundplant pre-installed, but in case you don&#8217;t here is the download link: <a href="http://soundplant.org/download.htm">Soundplant Download</a>. Navigate to that page and select <em>Latest Mac Version</em>. The download is a <strong>.dmg</strong> file which you can open once it finishes.</p>\n<p>Here is a quick introductory video to Soundplant made by Shawn. First, open up Soundplant so that you can work along with Shawn&#8217;s steps as he does them.</p>\n<p><iframe width="625" height="469" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ox0p0VrJzkA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Here is a step by step introduction with screenshots:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n<li>Launch Soundplant either by clicking the Launchpad or searching for it in Finder:<br />\n<img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf%20-%20elec%20-%20soundplant%201_finding%20it-600px1.jpg" alt="finding soundplant" /></li>\n<li>Soundplant&#8217;s interface is a virtual keyboard where you can drag sounds to load them. After they&#8217;re loaded, pressing (or triggering via MaKey MaKey) the key will play the sound!</li>\n<li>To load sounds, locate the audio file on your computer and drag it onto an empty key:<br />\n<img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf_-_elec_-_soundplant_loadsound-600px3.jpg" alt="loading sounds" /></li>\n<li>Keys that have sounds loaded on them will become colored, such as blue or purple: <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf_-_elec_-_soundplant_loadedkeys-600px5.jpg" alt="keys loaded with sounds" /></li>\n<li>You can download and import keymaps from the Soundplant website, or you can save your own. The tools for working with creating, importing, and saving keymaps are in the top left corner: <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf_-_elec_-_soundplant_keymaptools-600px4.jpg" alt="keymap tools" /></li>\n<li>You can change the <em>keymode</em> that Soundplant currently uses in the lower left corner: <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf_-_elec_-_soundplant_keymodes-600px2.jpg" alt="changing keymode" />\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>Play around with the different modes to change the triggering mode. Keymode-Kill makes it so that each keypress the sound starts again. Try out the other modes and figure out what they do!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You can switch Soundplant&#8217;s view between <em>detailed</em> and <em>simple</em></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>by clicking the <em>view mode</em> toggle buttons at the top of Soundplant: <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf_-_elec_-_soundplant_viewswitch-600px6.jpg" alt="viewmode toggle" /></p>\n<h2>Sourcing Sounds</h2>\n<p>Soundplant has some example keymaps that you can download. The Soundplant homepage has two free downloads that you can find about halfway down the page: <a href="http://soundplant.org/download.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soundplant Downloads</a>. This can be a solid starting point if you want to have a quick keymap to practice with.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.freesound.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freesound.org</a> is a great resource for finding Creative Commons sounds for use in your project. Freesound is a collaborative archive of sounds that users upload to the site. It&#8217;s a great, searchable resource and there are several different methods for searching and finding sounds. In order to download the sounds, you&#8217;ll need to register and login. Follow these steps to get started:</p>\n<h3>Getting Started With Soundplant:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>First, open up a new tab in Chrome and navigate to <a href="http://www.freesound.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freesound.org</a>: <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf_-_elec_-_freesound_start-600px7.jpg" alt="freesound url chrome" /></li>\n<li>Freesound has several methods for searching and filtering sounds. A quick way to start is to click on the <em>Sounds</em> tab and begin there: <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf_-_elec_-_freesound_searchinfo-600px2.jpg" alt="searching freesound" /></li>\n<li>Once you find and select a sound that you like, click on the link and you&#8217;ll be taken to a page with all sorts of info such as who posted the sound, different tags, a preview, and a download link. Note: To download sounds, you&#8217;ll need to register and login. <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf_-_elec_-_freesound_soundinfo-600px1.jpg" alt="freesound soundinfo" /></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Downloading Sounds From Freesound</h3>\n<p>In order to download the sounds that you find you&#8217;ll need to register for a Freesounds account. You should register with your Digital Harbor Foundation youth email. Once you&#8217;re registered, you&#8217;ll need to be logged in before you can download anything. Creating an account also gives you the ability to upload your own sounds if that is something you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n<h4>Steps for Registering:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the <em>Register</em> button in the top right-hand corner of the page: <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf_-_elec_-_freesound_reglog.jpg" alt="Freesound register login" /></li>\n<li>Fill out the registration page with your DHF youth email. There&#8217;s no need to put your first and last name, but make sure that you remember your username. After signing up you&#8217;ll receive a confirmation email.</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve registered click on the <em>Log In</em> button. Now you&#8217;re able to download sounds!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A good practice would be to download the sound files you need to a dedicated folder on either your user folder or</p>\n<h3>Saving Keymaps</h3>\n<p>One thing that you should keep in mind is that when you save your files to a keymap you need to have the associated files in the same folder. For example, if you have 3 drum samples loaded onto the A, S, and W keys you need to make sure that the actual audio files stay in the same folder as the keymap. The keymap points to where the files are saved on your computer, so if you delete or move the files, Soundplant will keep trying to locate the missing files. A good idea is to just keep the files altogether- keep the source sound files and the keymap in the same folder, organized by project.</p>\n'}},pathContext:{}}}});
