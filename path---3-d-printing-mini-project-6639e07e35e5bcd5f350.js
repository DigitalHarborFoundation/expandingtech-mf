Then, create your project. Once you are done, you will follow the instructions at the bottom of this post to create the Maker&#8217;s Reflection document. Once you&#8217;re done, show an instructor your entry. </p>\n<p>Please focus on making sure these projects are solid and well documented. Completing and documenting your projects is required for DHF Membership.</p>\n<h1>Project Prompts</h1>\n<p><b><strong><span style="color: #cf0000;">IMPORTANT: Please read this ENTIRE section before starting!</span></strong></b><br />\n<b><em>Note: Choose <b>ONE prompt</b> for your 3D Printing mini-project. Today we&#8217;d like for you to spend at least an hour working on the design before printing it.</em></b></p>\n<p>1. Create a design demonstrating an understanding of scale. This means taking something very large and properly transforming it into a design that looks similar. An example could be a 3D representation of Ft. McHenry or another Baltimore landmark.</p>\n<p>2. Create a tool, or an object that has a practical use. This can be a literal tool such as a wrench, but can also be something needed around the house/workplace such as the filament holders.</p>\n<p>3. Create an original creature, such as a robot or an action figure. This should be something that demonstrates knowledge of shapes and rotation.</p>\n<p><b>Advanced Challenges:</b></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re feeling super confident that you&#8217;re a 3D Design ninja, here are some advanced skills to test.</p>\n<p>1. Adding moving parts. This isn&#8217;t a prompt on it&#8217;s own, but see if you can add moving parts to one of your designs!</p>\n<p>2. Modular assembly. This is a fancy term for a design that can be assembled in pieces. You could design and print many pieces and then assemble them after printing.</p>\n<p><b><em>REMEMBER:</em></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save your work!\n<ul>\n<li>The first time you save your project, use the <span style="color: #0091c9;">File -&gt; Save As</span> option and give your document a name and save it to the &#8220;Documents&#8221; folder instead of the default location. While you are working, save your work every once in a while under <span style="color: #0091c9;">File -&gt; Save</span>. When you are all done, upload the work to Google Drive.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Take screenshots!\n<ul>\n<li>You can create screenshots to document your project as you&#8217;re working as well as upload the final product. This is a good skill to practice as you&#8217;ll want to get in the habit of documenting a project as you&#8217;re working on it. Also, feel free to take pictures of any sketches that you&#8217;ve done in your Maker Notebook!</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h3>Maker&#8217;s Reflection</h3>\n<p>First, you&#8217;ll need to create a Google Document for your Maker&#8217;s Reflection. Here are the steps to do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Login with your DHF email address if you aren&#8217;t already.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>. Since you&#8217;re already logged in with your email, you&#8217;ll be taken directly to your personal drive.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>My Drive</strong> from the left sidebar and open up the course drive folder.<br />\n            <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mkfdn-doc-gdrive_1-600px1.jpg" alt="Maker Foundations: Google Drive - Course Drive" />\n        </li>\n<li>Locate (and click to open) your cohort folder and find (and open) the folder with your name on it. In this example, Steph&#8217;s sample folder is selected:<br />\n            <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mkfdn-doc-gdrive_3-600px3.jpg" alt="Maker Foundations: Google Drive - Name Folder" />\n        </li>\n<li>Open the <em>Graphic Design</em> folder:<br />\n            <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf-graphic_design-makers_reflection_1-600px3.jpg" alt="Maker Foundations: Makers Reflection 1">\n        </li>\n<li>Once in the folder, click the <strong>New</strong> button in the top left corner:<br />\n            <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf-graphic_design-makers_reflection_2-600px1.jpg" alt="Maker Foundations: Makers Reflection 2"> </p>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Google Docs&#8221; option from the drop-down menu to create a document:<br />\n            <img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mf-graphic_design-makers_reflection_3-600px2.jpg" alt="Maker Foundations: Makers Reflection 3"> </p>\n<li>Name the document like the example: &#8220;Maker&#8217;s Reflection &#8211; Graphic Design &#8211; FirstInitialLastName &#8211; 16-T3&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Answer these 3 questions in your reflection. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What was the project prompt?</li>\n<li>What is your project?</li>\n<li>Why did you make this project?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, choose at least 2 from the list below to respond to.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How did you plan or prototype your project before starting?</li>\n<li>How did you make it? What was your process? What steps did you follow?</li>\n<li>What problems or challenges did you face?</li>\n<li>How did you overcome any challenges and solve problems that you met?</li>\n<li>What would you do differently next time?</li>\n<li>What would you tell someone else who was going to make this project?</li>\n<li>What did you like best about your project?</li>\n<li>How would you make it better?</li>\n</ul>\n'}},pathContext:{}}}});
