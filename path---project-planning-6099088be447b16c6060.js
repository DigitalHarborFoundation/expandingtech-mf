It is crucial to understand how to work through each step of the design process &#8211; from researching your ideas and learning more about a topic to making a project and sharing it for feedback. Professional Makers emphasize the importance of planning and prototyping. This is one of the core Maker Foundation skills youâ€™ll develop during Maker Foundations.</p>\n<p>Planning is one of the key skills in Maker Foundations that will be emphasized throughout. Planning will take a different form for each of the modules, but the important part is that each project will include a planning phase.</p>\n<p>Professional Makers spend lots of time in the planning and prototyping phase. The following example is from the show <em>Myth Busters</em>. The myth they&#8217;re investigating is the impact a falling glass windowpane would have on a bystander on the street. It would be impractical (and unsafe!) to test by dropping glass from the building, so Adam Savage decided to build a prototype of the building before moving to the next stage. After doing some research on the topic, he constructed an elaborate <strong>cardboard</strong> model of the building! Here&#8217;s the video:</p>\n<div style="width: 625px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-649-5" width="625" height="352" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/MythBustersCut.mp4?_=5" /><a href="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/MythBustersCut.mp4">http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/MythBustersCut.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h3>Maker Notebooks</h3>\n<p>Each of you has received a Maker Notebook to use for Maker Foundations and beyond. These notebooks should contain your project planning notes, and then these notes would inform one of the portfolio posts to your WordPress site. You should use your notebook to plan projects, record information, reflect on activities, and sketch prototypes. It should be a physical version of your design process!</p>\n<h2>Prototyping</h2>\n<p>Prototyping is the part of the design process when you plan your design and the thing you are going to make. Prototyping is important because you could come across a major design flaw or other discovery that would keep your final design from being the best it can be.</p>\n<h3>Why We Teach Prototyping</h3>\n<p>When time is spent accurately planning and prototyping a design, whether it be with cardboard, foam, wire connectors or even pipe cleaner, potential design pitfalls can be avoided in the fabrication process. For example, if working on a project that requires precise measurements of different pieces, these measurements can be taken and represented with cardboard beforehand. If the measurements and cardboard are accurate and approximate what the final fabrication will look like, then any issues with sizing and scale can be adjusted before creating a final version of the object.</p>\n<p>These skills can be considered an outline and rough draft process for your final design. Any issues that arise in this phase can be changed as they develop, and this saves lots of time in the long run.</p>\n<h3>Methods of Prototyping</h3>\n<p>Depending on the project, your prototypes will look different. In the case of a 3d printed project, scaled cardboard or foam models will let you gauge whether or not you need to change your design. Let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;re creating an object to clip on to edge of a table. Your first step would be to think about what you&#8217;d want to make and then sketch it in your notebook. After this, you would take the required measurements and jot those notes down as well. Once this is complete, you could build a cardboard prototype with the measurements that you&#8217;ll use for the 3d printed product.</p>\n<p>The benefit of taking the extra time at this stage is that you can see if there are any obvious sizing and scaling issues that can then be fixed before moving to production. Thinking back to the <em>Myth Busters</em> video, Adam Savage determined that cardboard would be an effective material for prototyping. He chose to not use any fancy or expensive material, and still had a perfectly accurate model of the building.</p>\n'}},pathContext:{}}}});
