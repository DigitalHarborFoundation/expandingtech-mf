It is an easy to use tool, quick to learn, and has a wide range of capabilities for more advanced design projects. Best of all, Tinkercad is FREE and runs in a web browser (Google Chrome is our preference), so you can use it on nearly any computer!</p>\n<p>You will use Tinkercad to design 3D objects, often called &#8220;Things&#8221;, that can then be printed on the 3D printer. Tinkercad can be used to design objects from scratch or modify existing Things (3D files) you find that other people have designed.</p>\n<p>Please watch the following video to get to know Tinkercad a bit better:</p>\n<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MwjWT-EvKSU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p>Now, you will create an account on Tinkercad so you can begin exploring this tool.</p>\n<p><strong>You must use Google Chrome for Tinkercad, not Safari or Internet Explorer.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong><span style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: Create a Tinkercad Account</span></strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tinkercad.com/</a> in a Google Chrome browser.</li>\n<li>Click on the <b>&#8220;Sign Up&#8221;</b> button in the top right corner.<br />\n<a href="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad_signin.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3982" src="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad_signin.png" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></a></li>\n<li>Create an account using your DHFTC email address.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Tinkercad Lessons</h2>\n<p>Now that you have a Tinkercad account, you will walk through some of the tutorials they provide for you in order to become comfortable with the design interface. These tutorials are important because they will teach you exactly how to use Tinkercad to design 3D objects.</p>\n<p>When working through these tutorials it is important to pay attention to the Tutorial Instructions, which can be found at the bottom of the screen, and the Control Panel, on the left-hand side of the workspace.</p>\n<p><a href="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6150" src="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface-1024x516.png" alt="" width="625" height="315" srcset="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface-1024x516.png 1024w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface-300x151.png 300w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface-768x387.png 768w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface-198x100.png 198w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface-624x314.png 624w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface-100x50.png 100w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface-750x378.png 750w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad-learn-interface.png 1439w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong><span style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: Complete Tinkercad Lessons</span></strong></h2>\n<p>Be sure you are logged into your Tinkercad account.
