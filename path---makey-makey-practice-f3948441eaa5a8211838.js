This lesson will demonstrate some examples of how you can integrate the MaKey MaKey with Scratch and Soundplant.</p>\n<h3>Goals:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand how a to use a MaKey MaKey to demonstrate a complete and functioning circuit</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>The activity in this lesson is meant to encourage you to explore the interactivity of the MaKey MaKey. Once you have an understanding of the materials that work with it and the basics of how the MaKey MaKey interacts with the computer, you should aim to expand your creativity by making interactive objects that are more involved than just a block of Play-Doh. MaKey MaKey has a library of guides that you can check out for inspiration: <a href="https://labz.makeymakey.com/>MaKey MaKey Labz</a></p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t already done so at this point, you should explore the different conductive materials that are available and practice combining them into new things. For example, cardboard in itself isn&#8217;t conductive but can be used to make a case or a mount/base for conductive materials.</p>\n<h3><span style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: MaKey MaKey and Scratch</span></h3>\n<p>Make a controller that interacts with Scratch. Start with your own Scratch game but also think about making a musical instrument using Scratch&#8217;s ability to play notes. You should aim to explore interactivity and create something that matches the theme of your game! The point of this isn&#8217;t to just be playing games, but rather to come up with something that matches the theme of the Scratch project.</p>\n<h3><span style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: MaKey MaKey and Soundplant</span></h3>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t read the <a href="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/lesson/introduction-to-soundplant/">Soundplant lesson</a> yet, please do that first so that you&#8217;ll have a basic understanding of the tool. Soundplant is great for interactive projects. Experiment with the software and come up with some sounds. Some examples are making an interactive robot or alien that makes different sounds when different limbs are touched. There is a whole world of interactive projects that you can (and should!) explore. Soundplant opens the door for a variety of ideas.</p>\n<h3><span style="color: #0091c9;">Bonus Activity: Advanced MaKey MaKey Skills</span></h3>\n<p>Once you have an understanding of how the MaKey MaKey works, there are some advanced options to explore. The first thing to attempt is to move away from needing to hold the Earth (ground). Think about how a switch works and see if you can come up with something that functions in a similar way. Additionally, ports on the MaKey MaKey can be remapped so that they correspond to different keys on your keyboard.
