You&#8217;ll then be able to change the image size and choose options for the image background. In this example, the <strong>Fill with</strong> is set to <strong>Transparent</strong>. This is important for creating pixel art. If you select white, your characters, logos, and other assets will have a solid white background.<br />\\n<img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MF_-_GD_Gimp_-_Gimp_2-600px2.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"MF-Gimp-2\\\" /></li>\\n<li>This is an example of a new document created with the settings from the above image.

The grouping of tools labeled #1 are your selection tools. You should experiment with all of these to get a feel for the individual uses of each. The grouping of tools labeled #2 are your movement tools. The grouping #3 are your drawing tools, including the <strong>Pencil</strong> and <strong>Eraser</strong> tools which you&#8217;ll use for creating pixel art.<br />\\n<img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MF_-_GD_Gimp_-_Gimp_4-600px4.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"MF-Gimp-4\\\" /></li>\\n<li>This is an example of <strong>Layers</strong>.
