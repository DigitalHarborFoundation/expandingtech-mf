This feedback and information gathering occur at all stages of the process, and once something is thought to be effective and work, it can then be integrated into a prototype of the solution.

If you look at the diagram, once you cycle through the other steps of the process you&#8217;ll land back at this first step. At this point, you&#8217;ll want to begin to <em>iterate</em> on your designs.</p>\\n<p><strong>What is Iteration?</strong><br />\\nIteration is refining a process or project through a series of repetition. Each stage of repetition is called an iteration, and the end result of one phase is then used as the starting point of the next iteration. This process is largely why the design process can be represented as a circle. When each new iteration begins, the feedback and results of the previous cycle are taken into consideration and improved upon until the desired outcome is achieved.</p>\\n<h3>Prototype</h3>\\n<p>After gathering some information about the problem/project, the next step is to create a prototype. The first step is to sketch your ideas and plans. This can go right into your Maker Notebook. Your sketch can be entirely drawings or a combination of drawings and notes. This phase should include measurements when necessary. The more information and planning you put into your prototype, the more refined your outcome will be!</p>\\n<p>Next, you should plan to build an actual prototype. This stage won&#8217;t always apply to the particular problem/project you&#8217;re working on. For projects involving fabrication, such as 3d printing, you&#8217;ll want to create an accurate physical prototype. For some of the other areas, such as Game Design, you may not necessarily need a physical object, but you should still focus attention on this stage to come up with a working model of what you intend to create.</p>\\n<p>Once your prototype is complete, you&#8217;ll want to begin to gather feedback about what you&#8217;ve done so far. This step is crucial! The prototype should be a way to avoid problems with your real production. Generally, the more feedback you get on the prototype, the fewer problems you&#8217;ll face with production.<br />\\nThis is an important skill when working with limited resources. The saying &#8220;measure twice, cut once&#8221;<br />\\nis a great summary of the prototyping step of the Design Process.</p>\\n<h3>Make</h3>\\n<p>This is the step that many love to jump right into, however, you&#8217;ll find that designing your prototype and receiving feedback on it before making the real thing is a great way to improve your design skills. Keep in mind that this may not necessarily be the final version of your project- it&#8217;s the first <em>iteration</em>. At the making stage you can (and should!) receive input and feedback as you move the design from prototype to actual version. The more feedback and information that you integrate into your process, the smoother the entire process becomes.</p>\\n<h3>Share</h3>\\n<p>The next step is to share out your project and continue to collect feedback about it. Feedback should be taken into consideration throughout the entire process, but this is the phase where you have the most dedicated collection of feedback. For example, here are some good points to identify:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>What would you do differently?</li>\\n<li>What worked?</li>\\n<li>What didn&#8217;t work?</li>\\n<li>What did you learn?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After answering these questions, focus on gathering as much information as possible in preparation for the next iteration of your project. Your project may be finished at this point, or you may need to make some changes based on the feedback.</p>\\n\"}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---design-process-13e705f4c03084514d9a.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressWpLessons\":{\"id\":\"a5c5c952-1c02-5a5c-a8ac-d78183e014eb\",\"wordpress_id\":675,\"title\":\"The Design Process\",\"slug\":\"the-design-process\",\"content\":\"<h2>Objectives and Overview</h2>\\n<p>This lesson introduces the <strong>design process</strong> as outlined and used by DHF.
