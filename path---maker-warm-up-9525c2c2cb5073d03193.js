In this lesson, we will learn a little about what a maker is and enjoy some videos of makers and the things they make. You will also get a chance to make something of your own in your first maker challenge!</p>\n<h3>Lesson Objectives:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction to the Maker Movement</li>\n<li>Understand what a &#8220;maker&#8221; is</li>\n<li>Identify qualities of a maker</li>\n<li>Make something!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>What is a Maker?</h2>\n<p>You will hear us talk a lot about makers during this program. <strong>Makers</strong> are people who create or &#8216;make&#8217; things. A lot of times the things they make solve problems but sometimes they create things just to see if they can do it.</p>\n<p>A <strong>makerspace</strong> is a place that provides makers with tools or training to enhance their skills. Here at the Tech Center, we consider ourselves a youth makerspace, which is a place where youth go to learn new skills and work on their projects. Essentially, it&#8217;s a space to make!</p>\n<h2><span style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: What is a Maker?</span></h2>\n<p>Please take a post-it note (or more than one!) and write down a response to this prompt:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A Maker Is&#8230;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you have written out your responses, please add them to the poster.<br />\nThis poster will be displayed as a constant inspiration and reminder that we&#8217;re all part of the Maker Movement!</p>\n<h2>Inspiring Maker Videos</h2>\n<p>To provide you with some inspiration about makers, we have put together a list of videos which highlight the culture and ideas surrounding the maker movement. We will watch the first video together and reflect on it, but please take a look at the other videos when you have time. We hope that these will inspire you and help you better understand the type of activities we are pursuing.</p>\n<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/66162292?color=f9dc39&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />\n<a href="http://vimeo.com/66162292">We Are Makers</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/learningstudio">Learning Studio</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a></p>\n<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/mlrB6npbwVQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_otrgJ8Lmx4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/faIFNkdq96U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yOc9mFvusDg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XOLOLrUBRBY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see what <strong>YOU</strong> make!</p>\n'}},pathContext:{}}}});
