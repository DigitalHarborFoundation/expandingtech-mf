The dress was designed by Michael Schmidt and Francis Bitonti. It was designed specifically for model Dita Von Teese and printed in Nylon by Shapeways.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3D-printed-dress-600px7.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed dress\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>Shoes</h3>\\n<p>Another fashion item that you may not think of being 3D printed are shoes. Many designers are creating intricate shoes for fashion with 3D printers.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3dPrinted-Shoes-600px6.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed shoes\\\" /></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3d-printed-shoes-2-600px3.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed shoes 2\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>Jewelry</h3>\\n<p>Jewelry is one of easiest to understand applications of 3D printing.

With 3d printing and some ingenuity, you can create your own wearable technologies such as an LED Belt Buckle:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3d-printed-belt-buckle-600px2.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed belt buckle\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Or, how about a 3D printed activity band:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3d-printed-activity-band-600px1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed activity band\\\" /></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h1>3D Printing in Architecture</h1>\\n<h3>3D Printing for Future Architects</h3>\\n<p>Here is a concept video from LeFabShop of what the future of architects and electric cars could offer.</p>\\n<p><iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gh13cQAxQCA?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"allowfullscreen\\\"></iframe></p>\\n<h3>Prototypes &amp; Models</h3>\\n<p>3D printing is great for producing models or prototypes of buildings. In the photo below, Charles Overy, founder of LGM, shows a model of a resort in Vail, Colo. &#8220;We used to take two months to build $100,000 models,&#8221; he said, adding that now they cost about $2,000.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3d-printed-architecture-600px1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed architecture\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>Your Dream House</h3>\\n<p>Explore your imagination and build your dream home and then 3D print it!</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/dhf-3d-architecture-600px5.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"dhf 3d architecture\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>Blueprints</h3>\\n<p>Take blueprints and convert them into actual models to get a better idea of a home&#8217;s layout:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chateau-600px4.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"chateau\\\" /></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3dprinted-chateau-1-600px2.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed chateau 1\\\" /></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3dprinted-chateau-2-600px3.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed chateau 2\\\" /></p>\\n<h2>Medical Uses of 3D Printing</h2>\\n<h3>Prosthetics</h3>\\n<p>This is an area of 3D printing that is really exciting. The &#8220;limited run&#8221; or &#8220;one-off&#8221; capabilities of 3D printing lend themselves very well to medical services because people are very unique. What fits one person, may not fit another person and 3D printing allows the medical field to create custom solutions for unique people.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3d-printed-leg-600px1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed leg\\\" /></p>\\n<p>We are also seeing instances where <a href=\\\"http://3dprint.com/2438/50-prosthetic-3d-printed-hand/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">open source 3D printed prosthetics are performing better than expensive prosthetics</a>.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3d-printed-hand-600px2.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed hand\\\" /></p>\\n<p>3D printing is offering new solutions for old problems. For example, a broken bone. If you have ever had a broken bone, you know how itchy and smelly a traditional cast can get. New 3D printed casts offer breathability and the ability to repel water that traditional casts could not do while still providing the rigidity needed for healing.<br />\\nAdditionally, the ability to fully customize the casts allows the use of new techniques such as ultrasonic technologies that help the break heal faster. The two wires in the photo can be positioned over the actual break and send ultrasonic waves into the break which has been proven to heal bones faster.</p>\\n<p>Read more: <a href=\\\"http://www.cnet.com/news/3d-printed-cast-uses-ultrasound-to-speed-healing/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">3D-printed cast uses ultrasound to speed healing</a></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3d-printed-cast-600px1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"3d printed cast\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>Internal Organs</h3>\\n<p>In this video, Anthony Atala talks about how 3D printing technology is being used to create human organs to address the high demand and low availability of suitable donors.</p>\\n<p><iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bX3C201O4MA?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"allowfullscreen\\\"></iframe></p>\\n<h3>Implants</h3>\\n<p>3D printing is also being used to create replacement parts for humans that have failed us in some way.
