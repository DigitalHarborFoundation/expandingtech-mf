There are a few different types of screenshots that you can take on a Mac, and here is an article from Apple that provides the keyboard shortcuts and explanations for each: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361">How to take a screenshot on your Mac</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you take a screenshot on a Mac, it goes directly to your desktop. All you need to do is find the screenshot, rename it according to the naming scheme, and then upload it to your drive!</p>\n<p><!-- include naming examples for the media as well as other types of photo documentation --></p>\n<p>Another effective documentation method is to take a picture or video of your project with your phone or one of the iPads in the Tech Closet. Once you take a picture you can email it to yourself, download and rename it, and then upload it to your drive. You don&#8217;t need to worry about staging the best looking photos. It&#8217;s much more important to capture your process than not take a photo for fear of it not being perfect!</p>\n<p>You can also use the <strong>Photo Booth</strong> application that is pre-installed on each Mac laptop. If you want to use this, you can type <strong>CMD + SPACE</strong> to bring up the Spotlight search. Once that pops up, enter &#8220;Photo Booth&#8221; and click on the app once it is located. Here&#8217;s a <em>WikiHow</em> entry on how to use Photo Booth: <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Photo-Booth-on-a-Mac">How to Use Photo Booth on a Mac</a>.</p>\n<p>For the mini-projects that are mostly digital, screenshots may be your best method for documenting. One of the most effective things that you can do is to take a series of screenshots throughout your making process. Just make sure that you&#8217;re labeling your screenshots in a way that is clear for you so that you can keep them organized!</p>\n<h2 style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: Take Some Pictures!</h2>\n<p>The goal of this activity is to take some photos of your <strong>ArtBot</strong>. Your documentation should focus on capturing the <strong>making process</strong>. One way to accomplish this is to take photos at different stages throughout the project.</p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take photos of the project materials and components</li>\n<li>Take photos of each step in the project, or one photo for every few steps. This is a solid way to create visuals that show progress and changes.</li>\n<li>Take photos of the finished project!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep those suggestions in mind while you&#8217;re doing the <strong>Artbot activity</strong>. At a minimum take the following <strong>three</strong> pictures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The materials at the start</li>\n<li>One picture of your process &#8211; sometime before start and finish</li>\n<li>The finished project</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: Take a Video!</h2>\n<p>For this activity, you should take a video of your Artbot in action! The video shouldn&#8217;t be too long- the longer the video the more time it will take to upload to Google Drive.</p>\n<p>If you want to video multiple steps of the process but you&#8217;re worried about the video becoming too long, you could always take multiple short videos!</p>\n<p>Videos could also be used as an &#8220;interview&#8221; where you record your process or reflect on the project. For example, you could always record yourself answering questions such as &#8220;what worked well&#8221; or &#8220;what would I do differently next time.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take <em>at least one</em> video of the Artbot activity! Try to capture your bot in action!</li>\n<li>Take <em>at least one</em> video of a reflection. You can answer one of the prompts above if you need a starting point.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Naming Scheme for Media</h2>\n<p>Here is a recommended format for naming your media: &#8220;first initial-lastname-module-project-name&#8221; such as &#8220;jprozzi-graphicdesign-character-1.jpg&#8221; or something similar.</p>\n<p>You should try to keep all your media consistently and clearly named. It may seem like more work at first, but it&#8217;s much better in the long run if you know exactly what your files are named and how to locate them in the drive.</p>\n'}},pathContext:{}}}});
