While it can be fun to remix a complex, large project, this isn&#8217;t the best way to strengthen your skills as a beginner. Choosing a project with the proper scope is crucial. We&#8217;ve included a <strong>Maker Foundations Staff: Fall 2015 Studio</strong> that contains projects by DHF staff members that are great examples of projects to remix to learn new things. Many of these projects illustrate concepts learned in both the Basic and Intermediate Scratch lessons. These projects are not meant to be fully functional games, rather they are examples of certain skills.</p>\n<h3>Goals:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand how to remix a project in Scratch</li>\n<li>Find and follow the Staff Fall 2015 Studio</li>\n<li>Understand how to learn from remixing and viewing code</li>\n<li>Practice remixing a staff project</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Learning Through Remixing</h2>\n<p>A great feature of Scratch is that all projects are publicly shared and open source. This is greatly beneficial for the learning process since you can play through someone&#8217;s game and then see exactly how it works. The goal isn&#8217;t to just change one or two things and make it your own- instead, you should aim to break down the way that the game works and then see how you can incorporate the ideas and code into your own project.</p>\n<p>One of the key goals of remixing something is to break down a project into it&#8217;s functional code. For example, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re playing a game and you really like the way that the character&#8217;s physics (how the character moves/falls) is handled. You could then remix the project and check out the code. It&#8217;s important to try to then do the coding yourself instead of just copying/pasting what someone else has done. Getting into the practice of doing this will help you out tremendously as you progress in your game development!</p>\n<h2>Staff Scratch Account Names</h2>\n<p>All of the programming staff have Scratch accounts that contain projects that you can <em>look inside</em> and <em>remix</em>. The studio is a collection of featured projects that are ideal for remixing, but make sure to <em>follow</em> all of the staff!</p>\n<h3><span style="color: #0091c9;"> Activity: Follow the Programming Staff</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the username of each staff member and follow them:\n<ul>\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ul>\n<li>Jonathan: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/jonathanDHF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jonathanDHF</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Click on the above links to go to the account page.
