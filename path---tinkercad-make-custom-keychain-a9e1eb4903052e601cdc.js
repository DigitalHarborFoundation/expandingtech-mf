This will be the first object you print on the 3D printer. You will be creating a custom keychain with your name on it that will look something like this when you are finished:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/IMG_0583-2-600px5.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>\n<h3><strong><span style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: Design a Custom Keychain</span></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Click on this link to the template you will use for your keychain: <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/a5urqzfDdAv-dhf-keychain-template-beta">Keychain Template-Tinkercad</a></li>\n<li>As long as you are logged into Tinkercad this should open under your account.</li>\n<li>Once you have the file open, click the <b>&#8220;Copy &amp; Tinker&#8221;</b> button.<br />\n<a href="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keychain-tinker.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6151" src="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keychain-tinker.png" alt="" width="808" height="587" srcset="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keychain-tinker.png 808w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keychain-tinker-300x218.png 300w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keychain-tinker-768x558.png 768w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keychain-tinker-138x100.png 138w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keychain-tinker-624x453.png 624w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keychain-tinker-100x73.png 100w, http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keychain-tinker-750x545.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></li>\n<li>When the template appears on your workplane, you can begin customizing. To access letters or numbers, click <b>&#8220;Basic Shapes&#8221;</b> and then <b>&#8220;Text&#8221;</b> in the right sidebar.<br />\n<img src="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2017-09-05-at-4.00.07-PM.png" alt="tinkercad keychain 2" width="600" /><br />\n<b>DO NOT</b> alter the size of the keychain without first talking with an instructor! They can help you if you have a name that is too long to fit.</li>\n<li>When you have completed your design, it should look something like this. Make sure that there are no stray objects anywhere on your workplane because those will cause your print to fail.<br />\n<img src="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad_select.png" alt="tinkercad keychain 3" width="600" /></li>\n<li>After checking your workplane for stray objects, select all objects in your design by clicking and dragging over them to highlight them all in blue.</li>\n<li>Once all the objects of your design are highlighted in blue, click the <b>&#8220;Group&#8221;</b> button at the top of the Tinkercad window.<br />\n<img src="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad_grouping.png" alt="tinkercad keychain group" width="600" /></li>\n<li>When properly grouped, your design will be all one color. It is now one object and is ready to be downloaded for printing.<br />\n<img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tinkercad-keychain-group-2.jpg" alt="tinkercad keychain group 2" width="600" /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong><span style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: Save &amp; Download in Tinkercad</span></strong></h3>\n<p>When you are ready to print your design, save and download the design by following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on your design&#8217;s name at the top left of the workplane and rename it according to your instructors&#8217; directions.</li>\n<li>Then, click <b>&#8220;Export&#8221;</b> on the right sidebar.<br />\n<img src="http://learn.digitalharbor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tinkercad_rename_export.png" alt="tinkercad keychain save" width="600" /></li>\n<li>You will want to choose whether you want to download everything in the design or a shape that you have selected. Then, download as a<b>.STL</b> file.</li>\n<li>Your file has been successfully downloaded when you see it appear in the bottom of the Chrome window in a gray bar.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong><span style="color: #0091c9;">Activity: Upload to FabHive for Printing</span></strong></h3>\n<p>When your design has been successfully renamed and downloaded from Tinkercad, you are ready to upload the file to FabHive. FabHive is the software that manages 3D prints at the Tech Center. Your design will be added to a queue of other design files and printed in turn. These next steps are very important for printing your design.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open this website: <a href="http://dhf.fabhive.buzz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dhf.fabhive.buzz</a></li>\n<li>Drag your downloaded Tinkercad file from the Chrome bar into the <b>&#8220;Uploads</b> space in FabHive.<br />\n<img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/fabhive1.jpg" alt="fabhive 1" width="400" /></li>\n<li>When you see the green check mark appear in the top right corner of your file in the Uploads section, your file has been successfully uploaded.<br />\n<img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/fabhive2.jpg" alt="fabhive2" width="400" /></li>\n<li>To be sure your print is uploaded, scroll down in FabHive to find the <b>&#8220;Jobs&#8221;</b> section and look for your print in that list.<br />\n<img src="http://dhf-website.s3.amazonaws.com/images/fabhive3.jpg" alt="fabhive3" width="600" /></li>\n<li>When you have uploaded your print, you can talk to one of the instructors to find out more about how the keychain will print.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span style="color: #0091c9;">Bonus Activity: Design a Table Clip</span></strong></h3>\n<p>Take a measurement of the depth of the table using a set of <strong>digital calipers</strong>. Make sure this measurement is taken in millimeters &#8211; otherwise you will have to convert the measurement to millimeters when you begin working in Tinkercad. Now, create a table clip using this measurement! Hint: you will need to create a hole the size of the depth of the table.</p>\n'}},pathContext:{}}}});
