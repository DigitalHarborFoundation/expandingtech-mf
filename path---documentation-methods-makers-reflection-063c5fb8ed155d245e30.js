These will be written reflections that are responses to the prompts that are included in the mini-projects.</p>\n<p>Each reflection can be a Google Doc that you create and name accordingly. Here&#8217;s an example of what a Maker&#8217;s Reflection would be for the Graphic Design project: &#8220;JProzzi &#8211; Graphic Design &#8211; Maker&#8217;s Reflection 1.&#8221; You would substitute your own first initial and last name, and then include the module name title it as a &#8220;Maker&#8217;s Reflection.&#8221; If you have more than one, you should number them so that you can keep them straight.</p>\n<p><!-- add these examples! Here are some sample reflections: --></p>\n<h2>Maker&#8217;s Statements</h2>\n<p>Throughout Maker Foundations, you&#8217;ll occasionally be asked to write a Maker&#8217;s Statement about the project that you&#8217;re working on. These are similar to artist statements and can either be digital or on paper. However, if you write it on a piece of paper you should take a photo and upload to the drive!</p>\n<p><!-- <strong>Documentation Tips</strong>: --></p>\n<p>If you navigate to your personal folder (and the module folder inside) inside the course drive and then create the document from there, it will automatically be placed in the correct folder. In the previous example, you would want to find the <em>Graphic Design</em> module folder that you made inside your folder in the course drive and then create the document from there.</p>\n<p>If you want to place screenshots or other media inside your Maker&#8217;s Reflection, you should still upload each photo or video to your drive. Once you embed a photo inside a Google Doc you can&#8217;t retrieve it later, so it&#8217;s best to keep always upload your media as well.</p>\n<h2>Professional Maker Portfolios</h2>\n<p>Here are some examples of how Professional Makers have documented and shared their work:<br />\nWe also wanted to share some examples from Professional Makers who have created portfolios of their work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.adamsavage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Savage</a>, from Mythbusters</li>\n<li><a href="http://billnye.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Nye</a>, The Science Guy</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.ladyada.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;LadyAda&#8221; Limor Fried</a>, owner of Adafruit</li>\n<li><a href="http://ayahbdeir.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ayah Bdeir</a>, founder + CEO of LittleBits</li>\n<li><a href="http://beckystern.com/category/portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becky Stern</a>, Director of Wearable Electronics for Adafruit</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/printrbot/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brook Drumm</a>, founder + CEO of Printrbot\n<ul>\n<li>great collection of videos showing the progress of his 3D printer development</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~ericr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Rosenbaum</a>, from MIT Media Lab, creator of Makey Makey</li>\n<li><a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~silver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Silver</a>, from MIT Media Lab, creator of Makey Makey</li>\n<li><a href="http://sylviashow.com/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Awesome Sylvia</a>, young female maker with own web show + book</li>\n<li><a href="http://lookwhatjoeysmaking.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joey Hudy</a>, young male maker\n<ul>\n<li>Famous for shooting a marshmallow cannon with President Obama at the White House Science Fair</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Examples</h2>\n<p>Here are a few other examples of portfolios that might be interesting to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://portfolios.mica.edu/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MICA (Maryland Institute College of Art) Student Portfolios</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://makerhq.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maker Headquarters</a></li>\n</ul>\n'}},pathContext:{}}}});
