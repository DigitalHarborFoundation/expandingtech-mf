The Web Development skills will contribute to your portfolio reflection, but aren&#8217;t considered as a major skill area for the final project.</p>\\n<h3>Tips and Best Practices</h3>\\n<p>One of the most important things to consider for your project is the <strong>scope</strong>. It&#8217;s better to plan something that&#8217;s smaller scale and then build from there once you make some progress. Remember a crucial part of the Design Process is the willingness to accept and integrate feedback. Keep this in mind when receiving any suggestions from program staff!</p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"learn-activity\\\">Activity: Brainstorm Project Ideas</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Begin to brainstorm project ideas in response to the prompt.
