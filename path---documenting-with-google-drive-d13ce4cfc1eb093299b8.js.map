This lesson focuses on how to use Google Drive to document the projects that you complete throughout Maker Foundations.

The distinction is that the folder that you set up within the Course Drive is used <em>entirely for documenting your projects</em> whereas your personal drive should be used to store any files that you&#8217;re actively working on, any resources that you find and want to save, and really anything else that you want to keep. Think of your personal drive as an extra, shared hard drive where you can keep works in progress that you can access from any internet connected computer.</p>\\n<p>The program staff will periodically be reminding you to always upload files to your personal drive, especially in the <em>Graphic Design</em> module. When you&#8217;re working at DHF you won&#8217;t always be able to get the same laptop each day, so it&#8217;s important to build the habit of uploading your files to your drive at the end of each session.
